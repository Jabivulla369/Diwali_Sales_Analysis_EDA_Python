This project focuses on analyzing sales data during the Diwali festival period. The goal is to gain insights into sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance during this festive season.

Introduction:
Diwali is one of the biggest festivals in India, and it is known for increased consumer spending. This project analyzes sales data to identify patterns and trends during the Diwali festival period. By leveraging Python and data analysis techniques, we can extract valuable insights that can help businesses make informed decisions for future Diwali sales strategies.

Technologies Used:
* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn

Data:
The dataset used for this analysis consists of sales data captured during the Diwali festival period. It includes product details, customer demographics, purchase amounts, and User ID.

Analysis:
The analysis consists of the following steps:-

Data Loading: The dataset is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame for further analysis.
Data Cleaning: Missing values, duplicates, and outliers are addressed to ensure data quality.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Descriptive statistics, visualizations, and correlation analysis are performed to gain insights into the dataset.
Sales Trends: The sales trends during the Diwali festival period are examined, including popular product categories, and customer preferences.
Customer Segmentation: Customers are segmented based on purchasing behavior and demographics to identify target segments for future marketing campaigns.
Results

The analysis provides several key findings, including:
